The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.', 'You can top bruschetta with more than tomatoes, too. For example, try Strawberry Bruschetta and Peach Brulée Burrata Bruschetta for dessert-like versions.', 'Read more: How to Make Bruschetta', ""The best bread for bruschetta has a sturdy crust and is firm enough to hold the bruschetta topping. Choose a loaf of Italian bread, such as ciabatta, for a more traditional bruschetta. This recipe uses slices of French bread, like a baguette, but a rustic Italian bread is more authentic. Slice the bread on the diagonal at least ¼-inch thick or more to make an oval shape. Toasting the bread creates a sturdier surface that won't get mushy when you add a juicy, flavorful topping. "", 'Quality countsThe beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.', 'Garlic optionsAs an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.', ""Make-aheadMake the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread. If you're going to top the bread first before serving, save that step until the last minute so the bread doesn't get soggy as it sits."", 'Read more: How to Dice Tomatoes', '""I made this for a bridal shower, and it was a hit,"" says Allrecipes community member libs.

Nothing to intimidate, right?"", 'Ultimately, conquering brunch with Benedict depends on doing two of these four things really well: poaching the eggs and rocking the hollandaise. Master these two make-or-break techniques and your Benedicts will rule brunch forever.', 'Begin by poaching the eggs. Add a tablespoon or two of vinegar to a pan of water and bring it just to a gentle simmer (rather than a jhard boil). Crack the egg first into a separate container. Now stir the water in a wide circle and add the whole egg. The slightly acidulated water will set the eggs quickly, while the whirlpool of water will keep the egg in a ball. Poach at a simmer for four to five minutes for set whites and soft yolks. Check out more tips on How to Make Poached Eggs.', ""Don't be dazed by the hollandaise. Hollandaise sauce is really just an emulsion of eggs and butter. Okay, yes, the eggs and butter must be blended at just the right temperature - warm enough to melt the butter; cool enough not to scramble the eggs - and then the emulsion has to stay at pretty much that perfect temperature until served. The secret? A double-boiler and a Thermos! The double-boiler ensures the eggs won't scramble as they heat, and the Thermos holds the sauce at the optimum temperature until brunch is served."", ""Carefully read the recipe, use a bowl set over simmering (not boiling) water, and stir, stir, stir. Hollandaise doesn't like to be rushed. Take the time to make sure each step is done before moving on."", ""No double boiler? No worries. Chef John makes his hollandaise without one. He does it in a metal bowl over a direct flame. Watch his video, Chef John's Hollandaise Sauce, and you'll see how to keep the sauce from breaking. He'll also show you what to look for that signals your egg yolks are just right."", ""Of course, if you're seeking the quickest, easiest way to make Hollandaise sauce, break out the blender. We have a video for Blender Hollandaise Sauce, too. This blended sauce won't separate or break."", 'But no matter how you make it, Chef John\'s most important piece of advice remains relevant: Attack your sauce with confidence because ""a hollandaise can sense fear.""', 'Creamy Hollandaise SauceSouthern Hollandaise SauceHollandaise Sauce', ""Now let's get creative. English muffins are, of course, the standard bread at the base of eggs Benedict. Their chewy texture contrasts nicely with the eggs, and helps absorb the sauce."", ""But don't get too stuck on English muffins. In fact, plain ol' toast is often cited as the original bread for eggs Benedict -- and really any toasted bread is excellent, from focaccia to challah. Would this include French toast? Mais oui! Even biscuits? Oh yes. For that matter, you could make a compelling case for laying down a base of hash browns."", 'A slice of Canadian bacon often comes next. But again, substitutions are the name of the game. Leftover holiday ham is always a popular option, as are other members of the ham family: bacon, pancetta, and prosciutto. Sometimes seafood gets the call -- smoked salmon, fresh crab (or crab cakes), scallops. What about a sausage patty? Oh yes. For a vegetarian extravaganza, try lightly fried firm tofu, or spinach, asparagus, artichokes, avocado, tomato, or just melted cheese.', ""And last? Top it off with your sexy, silky hollandaise.

This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe comes together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand.\xa0"", 'How do you know it\'s good? Because this deliciously easy recipe has earned nearly 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community. Happy home cooks call it a ""definite keeper"" and ""a Sunday morning favorite"" (among many other ringing endorsements).\xa0', ""Here's everything you need to know about making the best French toast of your life, including the best bread to use and what ingredients you need. Plus, get our best storage secrets and freezer hacks."", ""It's easier than you think to make\xa0restaurant-quality French toast\xa0in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!"", 'The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do.\xa0', ""French toast is traditionally made with\xa0day-old slices\xa0because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.\xa0"", 'Learn more:\xa0The 5 Best Breads For French Toast (And Bread Pudding)', 'Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients:', 'White BreadThick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones.\xa0', ""EggsWhen it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.\xa0\xa0"", 'MilkYou can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk – full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency.\xa0', 'Vanilla and CinnamonThe best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.', ""SaltDon't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product."", 'Butter\xa0Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.\xa0', ""Nope! French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.\xa0"", ""It's more likely that modern French toast was invented by 15th-century cooks who were on a mission to use up stale bread.\xa0"", 'Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a\xa0reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days.\xa0', ""Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months.

The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish."", 'Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).\xa0', ""Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.\xa0"", 'Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side.\xa0', 'To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping.\xa0', 'You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly.', 'If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness.\xa0', ""So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes."", ""The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be.\xa0"", ""You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want.\xa0"", 'Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together.', '""These turned out great! They weren\'t greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too.

Your tummy and your budget will thank you."", ""For dinner #1, Nicole uses the chicken breast meat as a shortcut ingredient in this recipe for Penne with Chicken and Pesto.

A mix of bite-size vegetables are cooked right in, making this truly a complete one-pot meal. Leftover rice is ideal for making the best fried rice, but you can also use ready-made frozen rice if you need a quick and easy option. Tip: Be sure to save the carcass for dinner #3. You can pop it in the freezer if you're not going to use it right away. "", 'Dinner #3 demonstrates that even the most picked-over chicken carcass can turn into a delicious, satisfying meal. Nicole modifies this recipe for Greek Avgolemono Chicken Soup by simmering the carcass in about eight cups of chicken stock until what\'s left of the meat falls away from the bones. Skim the froth off the surface of the stock as it gently simmers. Remove the carcass and pick off any remaining meat. Although the recipe calls for rice, Nicole likes to substitute the same amount of orzo pasta, but you can go either way. A mixture of beaten eggs and lemon juice adds the signature creamy texture and tang to the soup. Tip: To prevent the eggs from curdling, beat in a ladleful of hot soup into the egg and lemon mixture to ""temper"" it, then pour the mixture into the soup.

The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method."", ""Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan."", ""Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down."", ""Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:"", ""1. Pound chicken to an even thicknessPound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick."", ""2. Don't skimp on seasoningSalt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs."", '3. Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.', '4. Rest before cookingBefore frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.', ""5. Go easy on the sauce THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?"", ""6. Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go."", 'Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan. Enjoy!', '""Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed!"" says angie. ""As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor — I learned this by experience.

So, let's dive in and see how to make sugar cookies from scratch following this recipe, with lots of tips and tricks along the way to ensure cookie-baking success."", ""ButterUse unsalted butter that's just soft enough to be pliable, but not warm enough to be greasy. If you press your fingertip into the butter it should leave a slight indentation, but should not be soft and mushy."", 'SugarSimply spoon white granulated sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat edge of a knife, spatula, or bench scraper.', 'EggsUse cool or room temperature large eggs.', 'Vanilla extractFor the best flavor, use real vanilla extract instead of imitation vanilla.', ""FlourUse all-purpose flour. To measure flour, fluff it up with a spoon in the bag or container, then use the spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup and level it off. Don't pack the flour into the measuring cup or the ingredient ratio will be off and your cookies may turn out too dry and crumbly."", 'Baking powderBaking powder is a leavening agent and helps the cookie dough rise while baking.', 'SaltUse regular table salt for this recipe.', ""Cream the butter and sugarThe first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer) until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes. Why do you cream butter and sugar in the first place? It's all about incorporating air into the mixture. The micro pockets of air you create by creaming cause the dough to rise as it bakes so your cookies will be light in texture instead of flat and dense. Cool (not cold) butter works best; butter that's too warm won't let you create the structure you need."", ""Add eggs and vanillaAfter the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time. You'll want the eggs and vanilla to be thoroughly mixed into the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients."", 'Add flour, baking powder, and saltMeasure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl a couple of times so there are no streaks of flour in the dough.', 'Cover and chill the doughCover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.', 'Read more: Common Cookie-Baking Mistakes You May Be Making', ""Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle. Dust your countertop and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out shapes. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. This space allows the dough to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking."", 'Read more: How to Make Cut-Out Sugar Cookies', ""Good baking requires more than just popping something into the oven. For one thing, there's the temperature. Every oven heats differently. That's why we always recommend you use an oven thermometer to measure the real temperature before you start baking. And then there are the oven hot spots. To make sure your cookies (or any baked goods) bake evenly, its a good idea to rotate your pan halfway through the baking time."", ""These sugar cookies take only six to eight minutes to bake. You want them to be slightly browned around the edges but still light in color overall.

This is especially important if you're baking sugar cookie cutouts with intricate shapes. After the cookies cool for about 10 minutes, you can slide them off the parchment paper itself and reuse the paper for another batch of cookies.

If you've decorated your cookies with royal icing, which dries hard to the touch, you can stack the cookies.

So, let's dive in and see how to make sugar cookies from scratch following this recipe, with lots of tips and tricks along the way to ensure cookie-baking success."", ""ButterUse unsalted butter that's just soft enough to be pliable, but not warm enough to be greasy. If you press your fingertip into the butter it should leave a slight indentation, but should not be soft and mushy."", 'SugarSimply spoon white granulated sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat edge of a knife, spatula, or bench scraper.', 'EggsUse cool or room temperature large eggs.', 'Vanilla extractFor the best flavor, use real vanilla extract instead of imitation vanilla.', ""FlourUse all-purpose flour. To measure flour, fluff it up with a spoon in the bag or container, then use the spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup and level it off. Don't pack the flour into the measuring cup or the ingredient ratio will be off and your cookies may turn out too dry and crumbly."", 'Baking powderBaking powder is a leavening agent and helps the cookie dough rise while baking.', 'SaltUse regular table salt for this recipe.', ""Cream the butter and sugarThe first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer) until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes. Why do you cream butter and sugar in the first place? It's all about incorporating air into the mixture. The micro pockets of air you create by creaming cause the dough to rise as it bakes so your cookies will be light in texture instead of flat and dense. Cool (not cold) butter works best; butter that's too warm won't let you create the structure you need."", ""Add eggs and vanillaAfter the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time. You'll want the eggs and vanilla to be thoroughly mixed into the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients."", 'Add flour, baking powder, and saltMeasure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl a couple of times so there are no streaks of flour in the dough.', 'Cover and chill the doughCover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.', 'Read more: Common Cookie-Baking Mistakes You May Be Making', ""Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle. Dust your countertop and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out shapes. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. This space allows the dough to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking."", 'Read more: How to Make Cut-Out Sugar Cookies', ""Good baking requires more than just popping something into the oven. For one thing, there's the temperature. Every oven heats differently. That's why we always recommend you use an oven thermometer to measure the real temperature before you start baking. And then there are the oven hot spots. To make sure your cookies (or any baked goods) bake evenly, its a good idea to rotate your pan halfway through the baking time."", ""These sugar cookies take only six to eight minutes to bake. You want them to be slightly browned around the edges but still light in color overall. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely; they'll firm up as they cool."", ""Note: Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper allows you to slide the cookies, paper and all, onto the rack so you don't have to touch the warm cookies and risk bending or breaking them if you tried to pry them off the sheet with a spatula. This is especially important if you're baking sugar cookie cutouts with intricate shapes. After the cookies cool for about 10 minutes, you can slide them off the parchment paper itself and reuse the paper for another batch of cookies. Be sure your baking sheet is completely cooled before loading it up again. You don't want to melt the cookies before they bake."", ""The main thing to remember is to let the cookies cool completely before applying cookie icing or frosting so the heat from the cookies doesn't melt it off."", 'Read more: How to Decorate Cookies With Easy Tips and Techniques', ""Sugar cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about three days before they start losing their freshness. If you've decorated your cookies with royal icing, which dries hard to the touch, you can stack the cookies. Cookies decorated with soft frosting should be stored in single layers, or with parchment paper or waxed paper between the layers if you have to stack them. You can freeze sugar cookies in airtight freezer bags for up to three months."", 'Read more: How to Store Cookies', '""These ARE the best! I didn\'t change the recipe at all.

So, let's dive in and see how to make sugar cookies from scratch following this recipe, with lots of tips and tricks along the way to ensure cookie-baking success."", ""ButterUse unsalted butter that's just soft enough to be pliable, but not warm enough to be greasy. If you press your fingertip into the butter it should leave a slight indentation, but should not be soft and mushy."", 'SugarSimply spoon white granulated sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat edge of a knife, spatula, or bench scraper.', 'EggsUse cool or room temperature large eggs.', 'Vanilla extractFor the best flavor, use real vanilla extract instead of imitation vanilla.', ""FlourUse all-purpose flour. To measure flour, fluff it up with a spoon in the bag or container, then use the spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup and level it off. Don't pack the flour into the measuring cup or the ingredient ratio will be off and your cookies may turn out too dry and crumbly."", 'Baking powderBaking powder is a leavening agent and helps the cookie dough rise while baking.', 'SaltUse regular table salt for this recipe.', ""Cream the butter and sugarThe first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer) until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes. Why do you cream butter and sugar in the first place? It's all about incorporating air into the mixture. The micro pockets of air you create by creaming cause the dough to rise as it bakes so your cookies will be light in texture instead of flat and dense. Cool (not cold) butter works best; butter that's too warm won't let you create the structure you need."", ""Add eggs and vanillaAfter the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time. You'll want the eggs and vanilla to be thoroughly mixed into the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients."", 'Add flour, baking powder, and saltMeasure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl a couple of times so there are no streaks of flour in the dough.', 'Cover and chill the doughCover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.', 'Read more: Common Cookie-Baking Mistakes You May Be Making', ""Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle. Dust your countertop and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out shapes. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. This space allows the dough to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking."", 'Read more: How to Make Cut-Out Sugar Cookies', ""Good baking requires more than just popping something into the oven. For one thing, there's the temperature. Every oven heats differently. That's why we always recommend you use an oven thermometer to measure the real temperature before you start baking. And then there are the oven hot spots. To make sure your cookies (or any baked goods) bake evenly, its a good idea to rotate your pan halfway through the baking time."", ""These sugar cookies take only six to eight minutes to bake. You want them to be slightly browned around the edges but still light in color overall. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely; they'll firm up as they cool."", ""Note: Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper allows you to slide the cookies, paper and all, onto the rack so you don't have to touch the warm cookies and risk bending or breaking them if you tried to pry them off the sheet with a spatula. This is especially important if you're baking sugar cookie cutouts with intricate shapes. After the cookies cool for about 10 minutes, you can slide them off the parchment paper itself and reuse the paper for another batch of cookies. Be sure your baking sheet is completely cooled before loading it up again. You don't want to melt the cookies before they bake."", ""The main thing to remember is to let the cookies cool completely before applying cookie icing or frosting so the heat from the cookies doesn't melt it off."", 'Read more: How to Decorate Cookies With Easy Tips and Techniques', ""Sugar cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about three days before they start losing their freshness. If you've decorated your cookies with royal icing, which dries hard to the touch, you can stack the cookies.

The cool, creamy dessert became popular thanks to the advent of widespread refrigeration."", ""But icebox cake is far from some fleeting trend. No-bake desserts certainly aren't a novelty these days, but nearly a century after they first surfaced, icebox cakes remain beloved for their simplicity and unbeatable taste. "", ""Icebox cake is a no-bake dessert made by layering ingredients such as wafer cookies, cream, condensed milk, and fruit that set in the refrigerator. It's less of a recipe and more of a technique, because it's infinitely customizable as long as you stick to a cream-and-cookie base. "", 'As you may have suspected, icebox cake gets its name from the icebox, a non-mechanical form of refrigeration that was popular during the early 20th century.', ""Fun fact: iceboxes were called refrigerators before mechanical, electricity-powered refrigerators surfaced. Unlike the refrigerators we know and love today, iceboxes couldn't regulate their own temperatures and users had to supply the ice that would keep food cool. "", ""In order to capitalize on the growing popularity of iceboxes, food manufacturers, such as Nabisco, printed icebox recipes onto cookie and wafer boxes. These marketers didn't create the icebox cake, but they sure helped popularize it. "", 'The beauty of icebox cake lies in its simplicity — if you really want, you can make one with as few as two ingredients: cookies and cream. Historically, the go-to wafer for icebox cakes has been Nabisco chocolate wafers (this is especially true with zebra cakes), but your options are pretty much endless —\xa0graham crackers, homemade cookies, and store-bought favorites like Nilla Wafers and Oreos all make good icebox cakes. ', 'Icebox cake recipes traditionally call for homemade cream, but a pre-made topping such as Cool Whip makes a convenient shortcut. With additional ingredients, you can be flexible: fresh fruit, chocolate shavings, cookie crumbles, pudding, Jell-O, and cream cheese all make tasty icebox cake fillings. ', ""Once you've got your ingredients picked out, it's time to start assembling your icebox cake. "", ""Place the ingredients, starting with the cookies, in a springform or baking pan or large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients in as few or many layers as you'd like. If you're using a larger variety of ingredients, though, lots of thinner layers can make your icebox cake shine.When you're finished, cover the cake and chill in the refrigerator. Smaller icebox cakes will only need about four hours, but large icebox cakes work best if they're chilled overnight.Provided it's not gobbled up instantly, icebox cake will last two to three days in the fridge."", 'Ready to make your own icebox bake?

That's why you should skip the store-bought stuff and make your own buttercream at home. This top-rated recipe, which has more than 1,500 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community, is as good as it gets. Here's everything you need to know about making, storing, freezing, and perfecting the best buttercream of your life:\xa0"", 'Buttercream is a sweet and fluffy frosting made by creaming butter and sugar. Other common ingredients include milk (to create the perfect texture) and vanilla (for simple, crowd-pleasing flavor).\xa0', ""Though vanilla is the most popular buttercream flavor, it's also commonly found in chocolate or fruit-flavored varieties. Food coloring is also added for aesthetic purposes.\xa0"", 'Use buttercream as a frosting, decoration, or filling. Spread buttercream over cake layers, dollop it onto cupcakes, or create decorative patterns with a piping bag.\xa0', ""Related: What's the Difference Between Frosting and Icing?\xa0"", ""You can keep buttercream frosting on the counter for about three days. Though it contains perishable ingredients, the high sugar content keeps it from going bad immediately. After about 72 hours, you'll need to refrigerate it.\xa0"", ""Store buttercream in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days – just make sure to keep it in a cool, dark place. Keep the airtight container in the fridge if you don't plan to use the buttercream within three days. In the refrigerator, it will last for about a week.\xa0"", 'The buttercream will likely harden in the fridge, so you might need to whip it with a whisk or hand mixer to return it to its original fluffy glory.\xa0', 'Yes! You can freeze buttercream frosting in a freezer bag or another airtight container for about three months. The day before you plan to use it, transfer it to the fridge. It should thaw overnight.\xa0', ""If your buttercream frosting is grainy, it's likely because you're using the wrong type of confectioners' sugar. Make sure to choose a variety that's made from cane sugar, as it melts faster than beet sugar. You also might have forgotten to sift the sugar before mixing it with the butter.\xa0"", ""To fix grainy buttercream, try mixing it for a bit longer to smooth things out a bit. If that doesn't work, add a little more liquid or let the buttercream sit overnight (if time permits) to give the sugar crystals time to melt.\xa0"", '""This is so much better than store-bought icing,"" according to SizzleCakes. ""Just be sure to use real butter; it makes all the difference.""', '""I wish I could give this 10 stars,"" raves GCJMMOM. ""Like some other reviewers, I have always used canned icing, just because making it myself intimidated me.

There's probably an easy fix.\xa0"", 'This recipe should result in a perfectly thick spaghetti sauce. But things happen! If you somehow end up with a runny consistency, there are a few ways to thicken it. You could simmer the sauce for a few more minutes — this will reduce some of the liquid and leave you with a thicker sauce.\xa0', ""For a quicker fix, make a slurry with one part water and one part cornstarch. Stir the slurry slowly into the sauce until you've reached the desired thickness.\xa0\xa0"", ""This top-rated recipe calls for garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. However, you can certainly adjust, eliminate, or add seasonings to suit your taste. To make this spaghetti sauce your own, you could add parsley or spice things up with crushed red pepper. Just remember to taste the sauce every time you add an ingredient so you don't accidentally add too much or too little.\xa0"", ""We love the texture and flavor of this spaghetti sauce when it simmers for about an hour.

But just as I was starting to plan that redo, I saw another request for an update to our ""Just Chicken and Mushrooms"" video, and I decided to combine both inspirations, which ultimately resulted in this very delicious, and incredibly comforting, Chicken Mushroom Rice Soup.', 'Besides all the obvious things, what I really love about this soup is that the chicken is only the second most savory thing in it. Since we\'re slicing the mushrooms nice and thick, and browning them very well, they get very ""meaty"" in both taste and texture, and make this already hearty soup even more so. And while chicken noodle will always be the most iconic soup recipe, thanks to a certain canned soup company, I\'ve always been partial to chicken and rice. That comes down to the fact that I enjoy soft, overcooked rice a lot more that soft overcooked pasta. As the rice cooks it continues to thicken the soup, making it even more comforting, whereas the noodles just sort of fall apart.', 'However, one important thing to know about adding rice to a broth based soup is that no matter how much liquid you add, eventually the rice will soak it all up. It\'ll be fine when you first make it, but as it sits, your leftover chicken and rice soup will turn into a chicken and rice stew. This isn\'t a bad thing, but if you want to relive the first serving, you\'ll need to thin it out with more broth, so be sure to make plenty.
